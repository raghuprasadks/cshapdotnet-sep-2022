Write following programs in Calculator
assembly

1. Class EletricityBill

public double calculateBill(int units){
this method should return the bill amount
}

if units <=100 rate/unit = 1 RS
if units >100 and <=200 = 2 RS/Unit
if units >200 and <=300 = 3 RS/Unit
if units >300 5 RS/Units
Calculation is cumulative
if 150 units
First hundred - 100 X 1
Next 50 - 50 X 2
Total 200

2.Check classes,methods and parameters
